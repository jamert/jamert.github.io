Before spouting some timeless wisdom, I'd like to write down some reasons for this blog to exist.

I can just use unnumbered list, while I'm at it:

* Blog is an extension of your persona to online world, so with this, I can exist for people,
  who don't know me personally (I must say that most people don't know me personally).
* I want to get better at writing, so it will be a good practice.
* You know yourself by interaction with other people, so blog can be additional place to be
  my reflection, so I can know myself better.
* Of course, I want to write something awesome, but before that I most likely will write some trash.

Well, it's not much, but it's enough for me.
